  "name": "Divide and Conquer Algorithms",
  "description": "Divide and Conquer is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and then combines the solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is used to solve many complex problems efficiently. Common divide and conquer algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and the Fast Fourier Transform. These algorithms are often used in sorting, searching, and numerical analysis problems...",
