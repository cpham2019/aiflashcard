  "name": "Dynamic Programming",
  "description": "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used in optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions of its subproblems. Dynamic programming is characterized by solving each subproblem only once and storing the results for future use to avoid redundant computations. This approach is particularly useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Common dynamic programming problems include the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and matrix chain multiplication. Dynamic programming can be implemented using either a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach...",
