  "description": "A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have weights on the edges. Key concepts include traversals (e.g., BFS and DFS), shortest paths (e.g., Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms), and various types of graphs (e.g., trees, bipartite graphs). Graphs are used in many real-world applications, such as social networks, transportation systems, and recommendation engines...",
