  "description": "A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node C, the value of C is less than or equal to the value of its parent node. In a min heap, the value of C is greater than or equal to the value of its parent node. Heaps are used in algorithms such as heap sort and in data structures like priority queues...",
