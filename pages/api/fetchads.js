  "description": "Advanced data structures are specialized structures designed to solve specific types of problems efficiently. Key examples include the Trie, Segment Tree, and Fenwick Tree. A Trie (or prefix tree) is used for storing strings and supports fast retrieval and prefix-based operations. A Segment Tree is an advanced structure for handling range queries and updates efficiently, particularly useful in scenarios involving range minimum queries or range sum queries. A Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) is used for efficiently updating and querying prefix sums, offering a compact alternative to the segment tree. Each of these structures has specific use cases and advantages in algorithm design and data manipulation.",
