  "name": "Greedy Algorithms",
  "description": "Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit or is the most optimal at that moment. These algorithms work well for optimization problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution. Common problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms include activity selection, Huffman coding, and the fractional knapsack problem. Greedy algorithms are often used due to their simplicity and efficiency, although they do not always guarantee an optimal solution for every problem...",
