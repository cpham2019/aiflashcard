  "description": "Advanced data structures and techniques include complex and optimized approaches for solving problems efficiently. Topics in this category often include advanced tree structures like AVL trees and Red-Black trees, complex graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall for shortest paths, and techniques such as segment trees, Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Trees), and trie structures. These structures and algorithms are used to optimize performance for specific types of operations, such as search, insert, and delete operations, and are essential for solving complex problems in computer science.",
