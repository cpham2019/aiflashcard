  "name": "Time and Space Complexity",
  "description": "Time and space complexity are crucial concepts in algorithm analysis, used to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size, typically expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)). Space complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. These complexities help in understanding the scalability and performance of algorithms. Key topics include Big O notation, analyzing worst-case, average-case, and best-case scenarios, and understanding trade-offs between time and space.",
