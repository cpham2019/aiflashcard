  "name": "Backtracking Algorithms",
  "description": "Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and abandoning them if they lead to an invalid solution. It is particularly useful for solving constraint satisfaction problems and puzzles. Common backtracking algorithms include those for solving the N-Queens problem, Sudoku, and various combinatorial problems like the knapsack problem. This technique explores all possible options and chooses the valid ones by discarding invalid ones through a recursive approach...",
