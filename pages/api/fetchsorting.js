  "description": "Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a list or array in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Some common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Selection Sort improves on this by selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it in the correct position. Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time, while Merge Sort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them. Quick Sort uses a divide-and-conquer approach to partition the array and sort the partitions. Heap Sort involves building a heap data structure and then sorting it. Each algorithm has different time complexities and is suitable for different scenarios.",
