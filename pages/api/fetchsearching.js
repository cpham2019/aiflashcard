  "description": "Searching algorithms are fundamental techniques used to locate a specific element within a data structure or to determine if an element exists. Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and hashing. Linear search, also known as sequential search, examines each element in the data structure one by one until the target element is found or the end is reached. Binary search is more efficient than linear search but requires the data to be sorted; it repeatedly divides the search interval in half. Hashing involves using a hash function to map data elements to specific locations in a hash table. Each of these algorithms has its own use cases and performance characteristics, making them suitable for different scenarios depending on the data structure and the problem at hand.",
