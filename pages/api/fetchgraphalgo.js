  "description": "Graph algorithms are techniques used to traverse, search, and process graphs. They are fundamental in solving problems involving networks, paths, and connectivity. Key graph algorithms include depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and Bellman-Ford algorithm. These algorithms are used for finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and optimizing network flows. Understanding graph algorithms is crucial for solving complex problems in various fields such as computer science, logistics, and social network analysis...",
